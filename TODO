Check for reparent.
Only add window to list if its the window is a topmost window.
Use nvEncoder api directly? maybe with this we could copy the window opengl texture directly to the gpu which doesn't work right now for some reason.
    Right now we are required to copy the opengl texture to another opengl texture first.
    nvEncRegisterResource allows registering an opengl texture directly with NV_ENC_INPUT_RESOURCE_OPENGL_TEX and using that directly in the encoding.
Load cuda at runtime with dlopen.
Track window damages and only update then. That is better for output file size.
Remove cuda to cuda copy when using nvFBC if possible. ffmpeg is getting in the way.
Getting the texture of a window when using a compositor is an nvidia specific limitation. When gpu-screen-recorder supports other gpus then this can be ignored.
Remove dependency on glfw (and glew?).
